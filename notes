What is this program?
---------------------
The netdog project started with the aim of designing a program which can easily
bring computers up and down remotely. The idea came from the realization that,
quite a few computers were left powered up when the college lab closes for the
day. Thus the initial name "Project Green".

A number of features were added to the feature list, most importantly tracking
computers even if their IP addresses changed, the ability to execute commands
or scripts on a specified range of machines with a single command, and the
ability to copy files to a range of machines without requiring protocols such
as SFTP or FTP.

The abilities does not end there and netdog provides many notable features such
as early warning of HDD failure on the machines on the network. The exhaustive
list of features is listed in later section. Once completed, netdog will be
a completely extensible system to which features an be easily added through
plugins.


Basic architecture
------------------
NetDog has a client server architecture. The server is responsible for issuing
commands to the clients and is to be used by the administrator of the network.
The client application is to be run on machines on the network to be
administered.

After installing NetDog server on the admin machine, a unique public-private
key pair for the machine is generated which is then used for uniquely
identifying the server and securing data transmission between the client and
server.

When NetDog client is installed onto a machine on the network, a public-private

Track and identify clients through IP changes
---------------------------------------------
Ability to track clients even if their IP address changes. The clients are
identified not using their IPs, but using digital signatures. Upon installing
the application, the client and server generates public-private key pair which
is then used to identify the legitimate server and clients but also for
securely transmitting data between the server and clients. The application has
an inbuilt network scanner which can identify the server and clients on a
a network, thus
