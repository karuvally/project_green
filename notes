What is this program?
---------------------
The netdog project started with the aim of designing a program which can easily
bring computers up and down remotely. The idea came from the realization that,
quite a few computers were left powered up when the college lab closes for the
day. Thus the initial name "Project Green".

A number of features were added to the feature list, most importantly tracking
computers even if their IP addresses changed, the ability to execute commands
or scripts on a specified range of machines with a single command, and the
ability to copy files to a range of machines without requiring protocols such
as SFTP or FTP.

The abilities does not end there and netdog provides many notable features such
as early warning of HDD failure on the machines on the network. The exhaustive
list of features is listed in the next section. Once completed, netdog will be
a completely extensible system to which features an be easily added through
plugins allowing third party developers to further extend the system.


Feature list
------------
* Bring all computers on the network up and down remotely
* Scheduled power up and down of computers
* Execute commands/scripts remotely on machines
* Copy files to remote machines without third party protocols
* Track and identify clients through IP changes
* Secure client-server communication using public key encryption
* List all machines on the network which are not clients (detect intruders)
* Alert if daemon on a client is not running
* Centralized logging of all data regarding clients
* Track power-on power-off times and user login history
* CLI and web interface
* Log network traffic of clients
* Flag undesirable/excessive network activity
* Warn if machines have failing HDDs
* Warn if machines are overheating
* Control access to network addresses and services


Track and identify clients through IP changes
---------------------------------------------
Ability to track clients even if their IP address changes. The clients are
identified not using their IPs, but using digital signatures. Upon installing
the application, the client and server generates public-private key pair which
is then used to identify the legitimate server and clients but also for
securely transmitting data between the server and clients. The application has
an inbuilt network scanner which can identify the server and clients on a
a network, thus
