# what is this program?
the netdog project started with the aim of designing a program which can easily
bring computers up and down remotely. The idea came from the realization that,
quite a few computers were left powered up when the college lab closes for the
day. Thus the initial name "Project Green".

A number of features were added to the feature list, most importantly tracking
computers even if their IP addresses changed, the ability to execute commands
or scripts on a specified range of machines with a single command, and the
ability to copy files to a range of machines without requiring protocols such
as SFTP or FTP.
