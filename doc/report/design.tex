\section{Overall Design}

\par
NetDog follows the client-server architecture. What this means is that, NetDog
has both a client part and a server part. The server part is meant to be run
on the machine used by the system administrator, while the client part runs
on the rest of the machines on the network.\\

Both the server and client listens for connections from each other, allowing
the server to execute commands on clients and the client to report back any
progress. But the server has an additional capability that the clients lack, an
easy to use web interface that can be used by the administrator to control the
machines and configure the server.
