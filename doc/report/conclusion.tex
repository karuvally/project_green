\chapter{Conclusion}
\par A system has been developed with three modules. The user will register by giving his details and route details and he will be notified about the traffic in the route in real time. The second module is used to detect and count dynamic vehicles on highways efficiently. The detection and tracking and counting of moving vehicle can be extended to real-time live video feeds. Apart from the detection and extraction, process of recognition can also be done. Recognition techniques would require an additional database to match with the given vehicle. The system is designed for the detection and tracking and counting of a multiple moving vehicle. The detection of vehicles in a mix traffic situation of low, medium and high traffic is precisely as expected and the counting algorithm is accurate. Finally, the user details, route details and traffic details are stored in a server, which notifies the user back about the traffic. The server gets updated every 15 minutes and the OpenCV application for vehicle detection and counting updates the server with the help of a timer.
